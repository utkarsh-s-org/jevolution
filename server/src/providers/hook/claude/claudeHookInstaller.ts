 *
 * Deliberate scope choices:
 * - Casing is NOT significant: the token is normalized to lower case before the
 *   suffix compare. macOS and Windows — the two GUI platforms this ships on —
 *   have case-insensitive volumes, where `/home/x/.Pixel-Agents/Hooks/Claude-Hook.js`
 *   is the SAME INODE as our script and is genuinely firing. Reading it as
 *   foreign is what shipped: reinstall appended a duplicate (both fired), and
 *   uninstall left the cased entry behind as an orphan our own uninstall could
 *   no longer see — a running hook the user has no route to remove. The folding
 *   is UNCONDITIONAL (we do not probe the filesystem's case sensitivity), so the
 *   accepted residual is a Linux-only false positive that is NOT harmless: on a
 *   case-sensitive volume `~/.Pixel-Agents/hooks/claude-hook.js` is a genuinely
 *   DIFFERENT file, we classify it as ours, and uninstall DELETES it — the same
 *   class of loss this module exists to prevent, traded knowingly against a
 *   guaranteed unremovable live hook on the two platforms that actually ship
 *   here (see the removal pinned in claudeHookInstaller.test.ts). Nothing we or
 *   Claude Code write ever creates that path. The blast radius is bounded by the
 *   rest of the anchoring: a third-party hook differing in more than case is
 *   still untouched.
 * - The FIRST token only. A command is `node <script>` or `<script>`; our path
 *   appearing later is an argument or a comment, not the thing being run.
 * - ABSOLUTE paths only. We always write one, and a RELATIVE
 *   `.pixel-agents/hooks/claude-hook.js` resolves against whatever directory
 *   Claude Code happens to run in — so it names a project-local file that is
 *   almost certainly not ours, and deleting it would be the same mistake as
 *   deleting a lookalike.
 * - Suffix, not the resolved homedir: an entry written under a previous or
 *   moved HOME is still ours to clean up.
 * - A symlink ALIAS pointing at our script is not recognized (we compare text,
 *   never resolve). That direction is safe — a later install appends the
 *   canonical command next to the alias, so the worst case is one duplicate
 *   execution for a user who hand-aliased us, versus deleting a stranger's
