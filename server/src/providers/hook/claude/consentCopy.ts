 * Disclosure text for the hooks consent gate. Both surfaces show the SAME
 * in-app ask: the server ships these strings in the `hooksConsentRequest`
 * message and the webview's IntroBubble (the greeter character's speech
 * bubble) renders them verbatim on the Intro's consent step, so there is
 * exactly one copy of the terms and no client-side duplicate to drift into
 * asking for approval on weaker terms.
 *
 * Two pieces: the HEADLINE is the title of the Intro's consent step and the
 * DISCLOSURE is that step's body. The headline carries NO disclosure facts —
 * every fact lives in the shared disclosure block, so no fact depends on how a
 * surface renders its title slot (consentCopy.test.ts pins that split).
 *
 * The event count is interpolated from CLAUDE_HOOK_EVENTS, never written out:
 * a hardcoded number silently becomes a lie the next time the list changes.
